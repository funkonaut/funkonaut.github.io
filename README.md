# Notes
- Every post has to have a date which is used to order the sub tags
- Every post has to have an update date which is the actual date that is displayed at the footer of the posts
- Only one category and tag (cat and sub cat) per post


# To DO
- Maybe need to fix sub categories a little better? so it scales with more material right now its gonna be kinda a mess with the _posts folder and the date being used to order sub categories  
- Figure out how (or if possible) to change url generation to do category then tag then name instead of year/month/day/name so we can link to categories in the post footer
