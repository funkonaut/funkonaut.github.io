# To DO
- Maybe need to fix sub categories a little better? so it scales with more material right now its gonna be kinda a mess with the _posts folder and the date being used to order sub categories  
- Figure out how (or if possible) to change url generation to do category then tag then name instead of year/month/day/name so we can link to categories in the post footer
