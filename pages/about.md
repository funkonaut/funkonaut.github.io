Welcome to Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired Computer Science resources website. This website contains accessible resources targeted towards blind and visually impaired (BVI) students (but also beneficial to any student) who are learning computer science. There are not a whole lot of pictures on this webpage, but there is a lot of accessible text and information, enjoy!

<br>
As of the sites last update, {{ site.time | date: '%m-%d-%Y' }}, this site mostly contains resources related to OpenSCAD programming and command shell scripting with powershell and linux, but be sure to check back frequently. As our students and computer science program grow we hope to become a hub of knowledge and resources for both BVI and sighted students everywhere.
