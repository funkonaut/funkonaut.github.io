Welcome to Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired Computer Science resources website. This website contains accessible resources targeted towards blind and visually impaired (BVI) students (but also beneficial to any student!) who are learning computer science.
<br>
<br>
As of of right now, {{ site.time | date: '%m-%d-%Y' }}, this site mostly contains resources related to OpenSCAD programming and command shell scripting, but be sure to check back frequently. As our students and computer science program grows we hope to become a hub of knowledge and resources for both BVI and sighted students everywhere!
<br>
<br>
This web page is organized into two sub pages: Lessons and Projects. In Lessons you will find lessons organized into categories. In Projects you will find a list of projects and exercises organized by topic.
