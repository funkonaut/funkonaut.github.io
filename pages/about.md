Welcome to Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired Computer Science resources website. This website contains accessible resources targeted towards blind and visually impaired (BVI) students (but also beneficial to any student!) who are learning computer science.
<br>
<br>
As of the sites last update, {{ site.time | date: '%m-%d-%Y' }}, this site mostly contains resources related to OpenSCAD programming and command shell scripting with powershell and linux, but be sure to check back frequently. As our students and computer science program grow we hope to become a hub of knowledge and resources for both BVI and sighted students everywhere!

<br>
This web page is organized into three sub pages: About, Lessons, and Projects. You are on the About page. In Lessons you will find lessons organized by topic and sub topic, they will be mostly in tutorial format and will all end with a resources and files section where you can download relevant files (mostly code files...). In Projects you will find a list of projects and exercises organized by topic.
