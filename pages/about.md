## About
Welcome to Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired Computer Science resources website. This website contains accessible resources targeted towards blind and visually impaired (BVI) students (but also beneficial to any student) who are learning computer science. There are not a whole lot of pictures on this webpage, but there is a lot of accessible text and information, enjoy!
<br><br>

As of the sites last update, {{ site.time | date: '%m-%d-%Y' }}, this site mostly contains resources related to OpenSCAD programming and command shell scripting with powershell and linux, but be sure to check back frequently and make sure to pay attention to the last updated dates at the bottom of articles about setup and installation as sometimes processes may change and be out of date, typically they will remain mostly the same and we will try to update them regularly. As our students and computer science program grow we hope to become a hub of knowledge and resources for both BVI and sighted students everywhere.

## Website Layout
This web page is organized into three sub pages: About, Lessons, and Projects. You are on the About page. In Lessons you will find lessons organized by topic and sub topic, they will be mostly in tutorial format and will all end with a "Resources" section where you can download relevant files (mostly code files...). At the bottom of each lesson is a next and previous link. In Projects you will find a list of projects and exercises organized by topic.

## Recommended Sequencing
Depending on if you have a 3D printer or not and if you are accessing OpenSCAD non-visually we recommend trying to go through the introductory command line shell and 3D printing lessons after you complete all of the lessons in OpenSCAD Lesson 1. That way you can get up and running printing while you are learning OpenSCAD! Then once you finish all of the OpenSCAD lessons or at least lessons 1-6 move on to Python and the intermediate command line shell lessons. That said feel free to skip around as little or as much as you'd like. If you are committed to learning programming through this website you should go through and type all of the commands along with the lessons, and complete every practice problem.
