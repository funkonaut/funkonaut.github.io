## Fabrication Lab
### 3D Printing
1. [Your first thing](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Using thingiverse and printables to find models.
2. [Your second thing that solves a thing](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Solving a problem by using someone else's design.
<br><br>

### Laser Cutting
1. [Your first thing](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Make a box.
2. [Your second thing that solves a thing](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Solve a problem.
<br><br><br>

## OpenSCAD
### Lesson 1: Primitives and Debugging
1. [Dice Dice Dice](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Make 3 dice. Put your knowledge of primitives and resolution to use. 
2. [Fidget Squish Toy Slicing](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Make a fidget squish toy. Learn about all of the different settings (slicer settings!) to prepare your 3D models for printing.
<br><br>

### Lesson 2: Modifying Shapes and Booleans
1. [Make it your own](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Modify someone elses design using OpenSCAD.
2. [Solve a problem](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Interact with external stake holders, and use your 3D printing and coding skills to solve a problem.
3. [Make a necklace](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Make a two different types of beads and then assemble a beaded necklace with at least 6 beads. 
<br><br>

### Lesson 3: 2D Design Primitives
1. [Fix it up](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons):  Redesign someone elses design.
2. [Make it new](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons):  Improve on a concept with a new design.
<br><br>

### Lesson 4: Parameterization, Functions, Loops, and The MCAD Library
1. [Solve a problem, again](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Interact with external stake holders, and use your laser cutting or 3D printing and coding skills to solve a problem.
2. [Screw Loose](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Fasteners are fun!
