### 3D Printing
1. [Your first thing](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Using thingiverse and printables to find models.
2. [Your second thing that solves a thing](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Solving a problem by using someone else's design.
<br><br>

### Laser Cutting
1. [Your first thing](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Make a box.

## OpenSCAD
<br><br>

### Lesson 1
1. [Dice Dice Dice](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Make 3 dice. Put your knowledge of primitives and resolution to use. 
2. [Fidget Squish Toy Slicing](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons): Make a fidget squish toy. Learn about all of the different settings (slicer settings!) to prepare your 3D models for printing.
