## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1. Understand the physical structure of the Prusa Mini+ 3D printer
2. Identify and locate important components of the Prusa Mini+ 3D printer
3. Interact effectively with the control interface of the Prusa Mini+ 3D printer
4. *Optional: Safely handle and change the printer filament.*
<br><br><br>

*In order to get the most out of this lesson please have the physical near by and oriented so that the display faces you.*

## The Prusa Mini+ Control Interface
The main control interface of the Prusa Mini+ is the dial at the front right which we will use for orientation. The dial has 3 protruding knobs equidistantly spaced so it's easy to turn.
<br><br>

### Power
The power switch is located on the right side of the machine behind the dial. Make sure the printer is on. The switch should be pressed towards you. A flash drive should be protruding adjacent to the switches bottom right corner.
<br><br>

### User Interface
- Turning the dial scrolls through options on the screen. It is possible to [change the settings](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/sound-mode-mini-mini_151152) so the that the printer provides auditory feedback as you scroll through.
- Pressing the dial selects an option.
- Long-pressing the dial takes you back to the previous menu.
<br><br>

### Assist Setting Sound Descriptions
 - Scrolling through an element will sound a click
 - Clicking a menu element will sound a chirp
 - Scrolling to the end or beginning of the menu will sound a different chirp
<br><br>

### Auditory Navigation 
Refer to the [menu structure for the LCD display](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/lcd-menu-mini-mini_207531). Note that that the print option is only available if there is a print file uploaded to the machine.
<br><br>

*Please note that the Prusa Mini+ control interface is not designed for the visually impaired, so a sighted assistant may be required to set up your print initially. But once a print is started, the machine will manage the process autonomously.*
<br><br><br>

## Printer Hardware and Safety
### X  Axis Assembly:
Across the width of the machine is the X axis. The extruder assembly moves along the two X axis rods. The extruder is a brass nozzle which when printing gets very hot. Be sure not to directly touch it when the printer has heated up.

### Y Axis Assembly:
The print bed moves along the Y axis assembly. Try moving it so it is all the way towards you. The print sheet is flexible and held on by magnets. There are two bolts that a large tab along the top of the print sheet fits between. Try removing the sheet and putting it back on correctly! Removing the print sheet comes in handy for removing your prints off of the printer by flexing the print sheet. Note that the print bed can get hot when printing so exercise caution when removing your print.

### Floating Filament Spool: 
Unattached to the machine is the filament spool. It cradles the filament and allows it to un spool as the 3D printer uses it.

## *Optional* Changing the Printer Filament
