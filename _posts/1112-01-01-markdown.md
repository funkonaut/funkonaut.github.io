## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
- Understand the basic syntax of Markdown
- Create a simple document in Markdown
- Utilize their screen reader effectively to code in Markdown
- Open and view a rendered Markdown document.

## Introduction to Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting text. Its simplicity makes it highly accessible for visually impaired users. It enables them to create formatted documents using plain text, which is easily read by screen readers.
<br><br>

## Basics of Markdown Syntax
Markdown uses simple syntax to denote formatting. Here are some key examples:
- Headers are denoted by the '#' symbol. For example, '# Heading 1' would be read out by a screen reader as "hash heading 1", which translates to a first level heading.
- To italicize text, wrap the text with asterisks or underscores, such as '*italic*' or '_italic_'.
- For bold text, use double asterisks or underscores, like '**bold**' or '__bold__'.
- Ordered lists start with numbers followed by periods, such as '1. Item one'. Unordered lists start with dashes, asterisks, or plus signs, like '- item'.

## Creating a Markdown Document
When creating a Markdown document, write in a plain text editor to ensure compatibility with screen readers. Once your document is written, save it with the '.md' extension to denote that it is a Markdown file.
<br><br><br>

## Opening a Markdown Document for Viewing
In order to view your Markdown document with all of the formatting rendered, you can use a browser-based tool such as the [Markdown Viewer extension for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk/related). Once you have installed the extension and [set up the necessary file permissions](https://github.com/simov/markdown-viewer), you can open your '.md' file directly in Chrome, and the extension will automatically render all of your Markdown syntax into a beautifully formatted document. Keep in mind that the screen reader will read the rendered content, which will be quite different from the Markdown syntax.

## Screen Reader Tips
- When using a screen reader with Markdown, pay attention to the way your screen reader interprets the Markdown syntax. For example, asterisks might be read out as 'star', or dashes might be read as 'dash'. Use this feedback to understand and correct your formatting as you write.  
- Ensure that your screen reader's settings are adjusted to properly read punctuation, as this is crucial in Markdown syntax.
