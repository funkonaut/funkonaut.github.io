## Learning Objectives
This lesson is more of a bank of resources for designing or acquiring designs for 3D printing. There are a lot of ideas here and they will be updated as we learn of and develop more accessible resources. If you want a more of a how to we would recommend checking out the other lessons under the 3D printing heading on the [lessons page](https://www.accessiblestem.org/lessons/)

## Online 3D Model Repositories 
- [Thingiverse - this is pretty much the go to for most situations Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)
- [Printables - another very large repository for general models](https://www.printables.com/model)
- [The Models and Resources – Tactile Universe](https://tactileuniverse.org/models/)
- [Imageshare (benetech.org) filtered for 3D models](https://imageshare.benetech.org/?page=search&q=&subject=&type=227&acc=&src=)
- [Australia & New Zealand Accessible Graphics Group (ANZAGG) List of 3D Model Repositories (there is a lot of good repositories ones here!)](https://printdisability.org/about-us/accessible-graphics/3d-printing/repositories/)
- [tactiles.eu](https://tactiles.eu/database/)
- [APH Tactile Graphics Image Library (mostly tactile graphics some 3D models, requires free account)](https://imagelibrary.aph.org/portals/aphb/#login)
- [NoScriptum Geometry Models Repo](https://github.com/whosawhatsis/Geometry)

<br><br>

### Non Visual (Screen Reader Compatible))
These options are highly technical but accessible to screen reader users. SVG draw is a java application developed by [Professor Dick Baldwin](dickbaldwin.com), there are help documents included in the zip file. OpenSCAD is a 2d and 3d design program that is coding (text) based.
