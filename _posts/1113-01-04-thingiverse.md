## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
<br><br>

- Navigate the [Thingiverse website](https://thingiverse.com/) using a screen reader.
- Download 3D printable models from Thingiverse.
- Extract models if they are in a ZIP file.
- Understand the standard folder structure for models on Thingiverse.
<br><br><br>

## Navigating Thingiverse with a Screen Reader
Thingiverse is a website where users can upload and share 3D printable models. It is navigable with a screen reader.
<br><br>

### Searching and Choosing Models
There is a search field at the top of the page where you can put in search terms for a 3D model. Not all models are created equal. Some are more printable/ better designed then others. There is a "like" link after each model that is the number of model likes which is a helpful metric in determining model quality.  
<br><br>

### Downloading Models
Downloading models from Thingiverse is straightforward once you have located the desired model:

When you've found a model you wish to download, navigate to the model's page. Navigate to the 'Download Files' button and activate it. Your screen reader should indicate the download has begun.
<br><br>

### Extracting Downloaded Files
The downloaded files from Thingiverse can come in several formats, most commonly as .STL files or as .ZIP files. If the file is an STL file, it is ready to be used with your 3D printer software. 
If the file is a ZIP, it needs to be extracted first. Most computers have built-in software to handle ZIP files. Right-click (shift + f10) and choose 'Extract All'. The files will be placed in a new folder with the same name as the ZIP file.
<br><br>

#### Thingiverse Folder Structure
Once you've extracted the ZIP file, it's useful to understand the folder structure for most models on Thingiverse:
- 'Files': This folder contains the actual 3D model files. These are most commonly in .STL format but could also be in other formats like .OBJ or .3MF.
- 'Images': This folder holds images of the model.
- 'Readme': This folder typically contains instructions for printing and assembling the model, if applicable.
- 'License': This folder holds information about the usage rights for the model.
<br><br>

Each of these folders might not always be present, depending on how the creator of the model chose to organize their files.
