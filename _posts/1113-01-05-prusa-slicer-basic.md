## Learning Objectives
In this lesson you will learn how to use some of the basic features of the Prusa Slicer software to make your first 3D print. The graphical user interface for Prusa Slicer is not fully accessible but has several keyboard shortcuts and features that enables efficient low vision access and basic slicing can be achieved for screen reader users. 
<br><br><br>

## Pre-Requisites 
- basic Windows navigation
- basic folder and file navigation in Windows
- basic internet navigation skills
- a one piece, FDM printable 3D model
- working understanding of your 3D printer (read through the user manual or completed an orientation lesson)
<br><br><br>

## Steps for Basic Printing
In order to use Prusa Slicer to slice a model (prepare it for 3D printing) follow these steps. **[Make sure you have a model you want to print]()**
<br><br>

1. Import a STL file (ctrl + i)
2. Import the [config file *note: you may receive a warning about the file type in a different pane (f6)*](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons/tree/main/3D_Printing/profiles) (ctrl + l)
3. Select all and then auto position your model (ctrl + a > a) 
4. Slice the model (ctrl + r)
5. Plug in a Flash drive or SD card 
6. Export the model to your plugged in drive (ctrl + u). This will launch a Windows file dialogue where you can save your G-code file on an external SD card.
 - After your model is sliced stats about the print appear in the autogenerated GCODE file name. The default naming convention is `print-title_layer-height_filament-type_printer-type_estimated-time.gcode`  
7. You can now print your model by plugging in your SD card into the 3D printer and selecting the file you just uploaded.

### LV NOTES
1. Import a STL file (ctrl + i)
2. Import the config file (ctrl+l)
. Set the settings: On the right side of the screen is a side bar where you can load installed configuration profiles. You can click on the top drop down menu to focus the side bar and then tab navigate between the options:
  - The first drop down menu is print settings it specifies things like layer height and print speed, the larger the layer height the less print time 
  - The next drop down menu is filament settings, here you can select the Generic PLA filament profile you may have installed in the configuration wizard
  - The next drop down menu is the printer settings, here you can select the printer profile you installed our printer is a Prusa MK3s
  - The next drop down menu is the Supports settings, here you can decide if you would like to include supports in your model, due to the nature of FFF 3D printers anything on your print with a greater then 50 degree overhang will need a support, if you need to use supports we recommend just placing them "everywhere" when you are starting.
  - The next drop down menu is the infill setting, this is the amount of material that fills the inside of your model typically 20% is good, 50% for a more durable model, and a 100% for a solid model (this will increase print time and material usage) 
3. Now lets position and move our model. On the side bar under the settings drop down menus is a table with the different models you have imported into Prusa Slicer, you can select them here or by clicking them in the plater window (the large area to the left where your model sits)
  - You can adjust the position, rotation, scale, and size for each of the X, Y, Z dimensions of your model by typing in the text boxes in this list. 
  - You can also use the plater view and your mouse or arrow keys to adjust your model, you can select the tools in the side bar on the left side of the screen or with keyboard shortcuts: 
  - The default tool is the move tool (m)
  - the scale tool (s) will allow you to scale your model
  - the rotate tool (r) will allow you to rotate your model
  - the place on face tool (f) will allow you to click a face of your model and anchor it to the print bed, its helpful to use in place of rotating if you want your model in a different orientation.
  - a helpful tip is that you can auto arrange multiple imported models by selecting them all (ctrl+ a) and then hitting the auto-arrange tool hot key (a).
4. When your model(s) slicer settings are selected and it is positioned and sized correctly on the build plate (plater) you can slice the model by clicking the "slice now" button in the bottom right area of the screen or by pressing ctrl + r
5. PLUG IN FLASH DRIVE or SD card 
6. After your model is sliced you will see stats about the print appear in the right sidebar including the estimated filament used (in grams) and the print time. You can click the "Export G-code" button or press ctrl + u which will launch a Windows file dialogue where you can save your G-code file on an external SD card.
7. You can now print your model by plugging in your SD card into the 3D printer and selecting the file you just uploaded.
