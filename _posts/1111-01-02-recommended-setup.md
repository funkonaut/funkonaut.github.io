## Learning Objectives
<br><br>
In this lesson we will go over our recommended OpenSCAD settings for blind or visually impaired learners. We will split this lesson into three sections: "All Users", "Blind Users", and "Low Vision Users"
<br><br><br>

## All Users
We recommend the following settings for all learners new to OpenSCAD:
1. *In the Preferences sub menu (alt > e > p > p > enter)*
  - 3D View - uncheck "Show Warnings and Errors in 3D View" ???SHOULD WE DO THIS???
  - Editor - check "Auto-Indent" and uncheck "Enable Auto-Completion"*
  - Advanced - uncheck "Show Welcome Screen"
2. *In the Window Menu (alt > w)*
  - Click "Hide Customizer"
<br><br>
**Note: Auto completion is a great addition to an editor but as you are learning it will help commit the syntax to memory to disable the feature*
<br><br><br>

## Blind Users
We recommend the following settings for screen readers and the OpenSCAD application for blind learners new to OpenSCAD:
<br><br>

### Screen Reader Settings
**Note: We use JAWS but NVDA should be similar, if you are an NVDA user please let us know on our [github page](https://github.com/funkonaut/openSCAD_lessons) any issues or differences that you experience*

## Low Vision Users
We recommend the following settings for low vision learners new to OpenSCAD:
1. *In the Preferences sub menu (alt > e > p > p > enter)* 
  - 3D View - experiment with different "Color Scheme:" options to find what you like the best, "Starnight" is a good starting point (for white shape preview on a black background with higher contrast )
  - Editor - "Color syntax highlighting" experiment with different options to find what you like the best, "For Dark Background" is a good starting point.
2. Change the font size - control + + (hold control shift and =) or hold control and use the mouse scroll wheel
3. *In the View Menu (alt > v)*
  - Hide 3D View toolbar
  - Hide Editor toolbar
4. *In the main window of the OpenSCAD app (ie where you are when you open a new or old file)*
  - Drag the edges of the editor and preview windows to adjust the size as needed (where you type your code is the editor and where you see axises and soon your previewed shapes is the preview window)
