## Learning Objectives
Welcome to TSBVI's lessons on OpenSCAD. If you go through all these lesson and the lessons on 3D printing, you will be up and running creating 3D models in no time. In this first lesson you will learn about what OpenSCAD is, why you should learn programming in OpenSCAD, and how to download and install the program. You can go ahead and skip to the "Download OpenSCAD" section if you are ready to start coding in OpenSCAD!
<br><br><br>

## What OpenSCAD is.
OpenSCAD is a 3D modeling application available for Windows, Mac (OS X), and Linux. Open means its open source (ie anyone can view the applications code, make changes, or pose issues!), but what does the SCAD mean? SCAD stands for "Solid Computer Aided Design," this means that OpenSCAD allows you to build 3D models by combining different shapes (called primitives). 
<br><br>
What is really interesting about OpenSCAD is that it is all scripting based, that means you define your 3D models only using text and math (don't worry its the fun kind of math!) which makes it accessible to non-visual designers. OpenSCAD scripts have the file extension (ending) ".scad". A script based modeling application has many of other benefits, but we won't get into those just yet. 
<br><br>
We highly recommend you check out [OpenSCAD's website](https://openscad.org/) and [documentation](https://openscad.org/documentation.html) at some point. They have a lot of great learning resources, these lessons will cover most all of what they have to offer, but it is always a good idea to become acquainted with a program or languages documentation for troubleshooting and reference!
<br><br><br>

## Why you should learn OpenSCAD.
OpenSCAD is a great exercise in problem solving and visualization. Once you become comfortable with the process of 3D modeling using OpenSCAD you might find you really enjoy the process, and new models become a fun mental puzzle. That said the best thing about OpenSCAD and 3D modeling (in our opinion) is that you can bring your designs out of the computer in to real life using a 3D printer! 
<br><br>
While OpenSCAD is not a traditional first programming language, we like to introduce computer science students to OpenSCAD first as we believe it is a great way to foster the love of problem solving, a skill that not only carries over into every programming language but also every aspect of life. Additionally for BVI students OpenSCAD in combination with 3D printing allows for an amazing tactile return on learning investment. 
<br><br>
So much of the gratification one receives when learning introductory programming is visual, and in order to learn any new skill in life it is important to be consistently rewarded for hard work. For both BVI and sighted students the joy of seeing code realized using a 3D printer provides both important design feedback as well as encouragement to continue pushing and learning.

## Downloading OpenSCAD
To download OpenSCAD:
1. [Navigate to the OpenSCAD webpage](https://openscad.org/) 
2. Find the link on the page named "Download OpenSCAD..."*
<br><br>
**Note: This link should be dynamically changed to whatever operating system your computer is running (ie Windows, Linux, Mac OSX) if it is not you can find several download links under your operating systems heading on [OpenSCAD's Downloads page](https://openscad.org/downloads.html)*
<br><br><br>

## Installing OpenSCAD
To install OpenSCAD:
1. Run the installer file you downloaded
2. Click through the installer window dialogue and install the program*
3. Once you are done launch OpenSCAD and move on to the next lesson.
<br><br>
**Note: You may need admin privileges to install OpenSCAD on your computer.*
<br><br><br>
