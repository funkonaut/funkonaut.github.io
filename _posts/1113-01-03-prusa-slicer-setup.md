1. Launch preferences (alt c > p or control + p) and under General Preferences, make sure the following options are checked or unchecked (in addition to the defaults already checked):

  - Allow just a single PrusaSlicer instance: so you don't start too many windows of PrusaSlicer

  - **UNCHECK** Ask to save unsaved changes in presents  when closing the application or when loading a new project
  - **UNCHECK** Ask for unsaved changes in presents when selecting new preset
  - **UNCHECK** Ask for unsaved changes in presents when creating a new project

2. Change to the GUI tab in preferences, make sure the following options are checked or unchecked(in addition to the defaults already checked):
  - Use colors for axes values in Manipulation panel (will highlight the XYZ options in the right sidebar for manipulating an object, a model has to be loaded to see the Manipulation panel, optional if the contrast works for you)
  - Set settings tabs as menu items (experimental) - **this is one of the most important preferences it enables accessing the different settings windows via the windows menu (alt)**
  - **UNCHECK** Show "Tip of the day" notification after start
