## Learning Objectives
As of this post's last update this is a list of links for current AI tools and resources. Right now not everything is vetted for screen reader usage, please [email me](mailto:correllc@tsbvi.edu) if you have any updates. Feel free to use this and pass it along, share everything you make, and please share this website and article if you do!

## Popular AI Tools (no code needed)
- [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - this in itself a whole two-day course text generation is huge right now, you'll need to sign up for it (free)
  - A little inefficient for screen readers usage
    - Ctrl home > read all command to read through chat thread
    - I believe the chat input box is a form field
- [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) - text to art generation makes really nice “fine art” you can access it via discord chat servers
- [OpenAI Dalle2](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) -  text to art generation some free credits but will cost money after a certain amount of images are generated 
- [Stable Diffusion](https://www.canva.com/ai-image-generator/) - this is what Canva uses you can pay for services to run it (free trial) or you can run it for free using a google colab notebook (lots of models below under AI Code heading) but it allows you to modify photos with AI generated background stylizing etc.
- [Hugging face](https://huggingface.co/spaces) - Interesting models and interactive AI demos that are under development
- [Make.avideo](https://makeavideo.studio/) - Text to Video (still in beta have to sign up)
<br><br><br>

## AI Code
- [MNIST data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) - usually the first neural network one programs is to recognize handwritten characters this is the data folks train on it)
- [Github Co-Pilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - automatic code writing and helping
- [Google Colab Notebooks Tuorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMlMfrXJYSg&ab_channel=AmitThinks) these will be where most AI code and models you can interact with are written, learning how to use it will enable you to do some really cool stuff, should know python they will sometimes require modifications if they are out of date, sometimes they are as simple as placing your file in the input directory and then running them
  - [Stable Diffusion](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast_stable_diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.ipynb)
  - [Github Repo of Colab Notebooks](https://github.com/mrm8488/shared_colab_notebooks)
- [Style Transfer Github Repo](https://github.com/dobrosketchkun/latent_space_adventures#updates-mix-layers) - making images in the style of other images
- [Frame Interpolation Github Repo](https://github.com/google-research/frame-interpolation) - morphing in between images
- [Tortoise Text to Speech Github repo](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts) - Custom Text to Speech Synthesis
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) - good source of datasets to train with
<br><br><br>

## AI Math
- [Good video playlist about the math behind neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PL_h2yd2CGtBHEKwEH5iqTZH85wLS-eUzv&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)
- [Overview of math that is important to know for developing AI models](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/all-the-math-you-need-in-artificial-intelligence/)
<br><br><br>

## Project Ideas
- Find a hugging face demo (space) and explain how the AI model could be used to help someone who is visually impaired
- Use ChatGPT to write a script and then story board it with Midjourney or OpenAI Dalle2
- Run a google Colab notebook with your own input 
- Write a handwriting recognizer neural network using the the MNIST data set
